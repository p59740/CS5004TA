##### Q: Errors running tests: 

![image-20230924224759269](http://pygr.nicey.xyz/learnpython/202309242343928.png)

##### A: This error occurs due to a missing package structure in your directory.

**Solution**:

Ensure that your directory structure matches the following:

**Modification** **Steps**:

> 1. Build the package:
>    Right-click on the src directory.
>    Select "New" -> "Package."

> 2. Refactor the class "WeatherReading:
> by dragging the class file into the newly created weather package.

## Lab1 Design walkthrough

#### Instructions

##### Digital version

###### File Types: PDF, etc

###### Use digital versions for both the `UML` and `test plan` instead of handwriting

>  Feel free to use intelligent diagramming apps like Lucidchart, Google Draw, Visio, OmniGraffle, etc.

##### Submission

###### Autograder on [Handins](https://handins.ccs.neu.edu/) portal (which does not autograde the lab, just for bookkeeping)

###### can Submit multiple times before the due date; grading based on finalized version

##### Grade

###### Grading happens during walkthrough

#### Test plan

##### Sample: suggested but not **mandatory**

- ###### What needs to be tested

- ###### Case for General case, edge case or corner case...

- ###### How it will be tested

- ###### Expected results

#### UML diagrams

##### For a single class, to describe:

###### attributes: modifiers, type...

###### constructor : arguments and their types, modifiers...

###### methods: arguments and their types, modifiers,return...

###### * NOTE: The following sample lacks a constructor.

# OOD

#### Abstract class

##### E.g.

###### An abstract class:

```java
public abstract class Animal {
    //"protected": an access modifier that specifies the visibility of the instance variable
   //It is can accessible only inside of the class or its subclasses.
    protected String name;

    public Animal(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public abstract void makeSound();
}

```

###### a concrete subclass:

```java
public class Dog extends Animal {
    public Dog(String name) {
        super(name);
    }

    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println(name + " barks");
    }
}

```

##### Properties

###### An abstract class is a class that <u>cannot be instantiated on its own</u>; it's meant to be subclassed by other classes. 

###### Abstract classes can provide a common interface and implementation details for their subclasses.

##### comparison : abstract classes VS interfaces

| Feature                | Abstract Classes                                             | Interfaces                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Variables              | Can have <u>instance variables</u> with values.              | Cannot have instance variables with values. Only <u>constant values</u> are allowed. |
| Constructors           | Can define constructors; instances of concrete subclasses are created using them. | Cannot                                                       |
| Method Implementations | Can provide method implementations along with abstract methods. | Can only declare method signatures (<u>abstract methods</u>); implementations are provided by implementing classes. |
| Code Reusability       | Used for sharing common code <u>among related classes</u>; provides attributes and behavior. | Used for defining a contract of method signatures; ensures consistent behavior <u>across unrelated classes</u>.(**Unrelated class can have the same actions/methods**) |
| Multiple Inheritance   | Supports single inheritance; a class <u>can extend only one</u> abstract class. | Supports multiple inheritance; a class <u>can implement multiple interfaces</u>. |
